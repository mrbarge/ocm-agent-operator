# OCM Agent Operator Design

## Controllers

### OCMAgent Controller

The [OCMAgent Controller](https://github.com/openshift/ocm-agent-operator/tree/master/pkg/controller/ocmagent/ocmagent_controller.go) is responsible for ensuring the deployment or removal of an OCM Agent based upon the presence of an `OCMAgent` Custom Resource.

An `OcmAgent` deployment consists of:
- A `ServiceAccount` (named `ocm-agent`)
- A `Role` and `RoleBinding` (both named `ocm-agent`) that defines the OCM Agent's API  permissions.
- A `Deployment` (named `ocm-agent`) which runs the [ocm-agent](https://quay.io/openshift/ocm-agent)
- A `ConfigMap` (name defined in the `OcmAgent` CR) which contains the agent's configuration.
- A `Secret` (name defined in the `OcmAgent` CR) which contains the agent's OCM access token.
- A `Service` (named `ocm-agent`) which serves the OCM Agent API
- A `NetworkPolicy` to only grant ingress from specific cluster clients.
 
The controller watches for changes to the above resources in its deployed namespace, in addition to changes to the cluster pull secret (`openshift-config/pull-secret`) which contains the OCM Agent's auth token.
